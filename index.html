                <p>The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development fundamentals,
                    including an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and
                    JavaScript.
                    Many aspiring Web Developers are now using coding bootcamps to fast-track the learning process.
                    Coding bootcamps have thrived because they are short, immersive, and focused on outcomes and
                    employment – their goal is to develop job-ready skills as efficiently as possible, making them an
                    increasingly worthwhile investment for a would-be Web Developer.</p>

                <p>Have everyone ages 5 and older get their COVID-19 vaccination and booster if eligible. Limit the
                    number and size of indoor gatherings. Wear a well-fitted mask indoors and in crowded settings. To
                    best protect yourself, wear an N95 or double mask with a cloth mask over a surgical mask to improve
                    the seal.
                    Unvaccinated adults should avoid travel and gatherings outside their household. Wash hands or use
                    hand sanitizer often.Layer your defenses, and reduce your household’s risk exposure during periods
                    of high transmission, like the current Omicron surge.</p>
